Description: stable hashes functions for PostgreSQL
 The goal of pghashlib is to provide stable hashes for PostgreSQL,
 "stable" in the sense that their implementation does not change,
 they are independent from PostgeSQL version.
 .
 Some string hashes may be dependent on CPU architecture,
 so that they return different return on big-endian
 architecture from little-endian architecture.
 It you want to be architectures-independent, then
 use algorithms that don't depend on endianness.
